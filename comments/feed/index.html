					<description><![CDATA[Developer without pride and accountability in the building they build. no attention to detail to finishes. Had cracked tiles and a row of tiles with big scratch before moving in. Chased for a full year and developer did not fix scratch tiles. Paint job was poorly done and unfinished in areas not easily visible. Settlement process was horrific with selling agent - not responsive at all. Lucky to have good strata manager to follow up on defects to be fixed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We were referred to Eric through our close friends and are so happy with the service he provided! This was our first house, so we had a lot of questions and he was happy to answer them all! He also went to bat for us and guided us to make smart decisions when it came to the negotiations. I hope to not move again anytime soon, but when we do, we know who to call!
