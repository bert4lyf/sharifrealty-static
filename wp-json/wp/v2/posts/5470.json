Community Partnership Committee, explains Lynn Hackworth, the association\u2019s Manager of Equity and Impact.\u00a0 \u201cThe concept of tiny homes has been on our radar for a while, as it addresses some of our top priorities, namely affordable housing and sustainability.\u00a0 We were pleased to be able to bring together key experts for our panel: a co-founder of Modern Tiny Living, a custom tiny house design\/build company; a Columbus City Councilmember who is also a REALTOR<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>; an officer of the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus; a partner in Vista Village Tiny Home project, a local 20-acre non-profit; and a lending professional.\u00a0 Between them, they covered a comprehensive range of issues, from zoning to financing, and answered lots of questions from the audience, which was highly engaged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Ida Seitter, the Director of Community &amp; PAC Engagement for Columbus REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, a driving force behind the forum was the projection that central Ohio\u2019s population will triple by 2050: \u201cThe university presence in Columbus makes us something of an incubator for new business.\u00a0 Intel Corporation will be moving up to 12K employees here in the coming years.\u00a0 Where are these people going to live?\u00a0 The conventional stick-build housing just won\u2019t work anymore.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to take dense in-fill housing, and plenty of it.\u00a0 Tiny homes are especially well suited to the need.\u201d\u00a0 Columbus REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Foundation already has first-hand experience with tiny homes, she notes, as the $100K sponsors of a single home within Vista Village, which provides transitional housing, along with access to medical and mental health care, for those in need.<\/p>\n<p>Columbus REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u2019 Sustainability Forum Committee Chair Jan Jedlinsky points out that the tiny homes, which could be built in the area for $75K-$120K, are not only for those seeking affordability.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re learning that there\u2019s high interest in these as \u2018granny pods,\u2019 for example,\u201d she says. \u00a0\u201cWhether a tiny home is intended as a stand-alone house or as an accessory dwelling unit, as a custom build, there is an opportunity to use luxury finishes \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about lots of materials, after all: they\u2019re tiny!\u201d \u00a0She notes that the construction of a tiny home is inherently energy efficient, and their carbon footprint is small.\u00a0 \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised by the fact that our capacity audience at this forum was younger and more diverse than usual.\u00a0 Our members weren\u2019t getting CE credits for this, they are truly interested in this concept, as were our community partners, which is wonderful, because we\u2019ll be relying on them to apply pressure when the City Council takes up the zoning amendments that will make tiny home development possible here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was the Housing Opportunity grant from the REALTOR<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Party that enabled Modern Tiny Living to transport a model tiny home to the forum for an \u2018open house.\u2019\u00a0 Hackworth reports that applying for REALTOR<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Party grants is easy and accessible.\u00a0 \u201cWe had an answer within a week, and were really pleased, because we weren\u2019t initially sure that our proposal would meet their criteria.\u00a0 I\u2019d encourage any association to go ahead and call them to talk through your ideas and see what is possible.\u00a0 The bottom line is that they want to support your success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how Columbus REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0is helping central Ohio explore all the options when it comes to increasing affordable housing, contact Lynn Hackworth, Manager of Equity and Impact, at \u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Lhackworth@ColumbusRealtors.com\" data-di-id=\"di-id-b7cf9846-3d50b2d4\">Lhackworth@ColumbusRealtors.com<\/a>;
