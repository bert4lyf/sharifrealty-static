Fraites, a lobbyist with Florida REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, points out that the campaign made it clear to jurisdictions across the state that the REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0and their allies were more than ready to fight the cause. \u00a0\u201cIn choosing to disregard the findings of their consultant\u2019s study, the County Commission showed us how determined they were to establish rent control in their area..\u00a0 Having to mount an Issues Mobilization campaign to speak directly to Orange County voters gave us a double advantage:\u00a0 it elevated their understanding of the issue and set a high-profile example for the rest of the state, which we knew would be watching closely.\u00a0 Instead of fighting individual battles in Florida\u2019s 67 counties, we were able to get out in front of the issue and hopefully fight this battle only once.\u00a0 This really was a huge victory, and the outcome has already influenced how other areas of the state are dealing with the prospect of rent control.\u201d Casanova agrees:\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be engaged in protecting private property rights, state-wide.\u00a0 This win gives us the momentum to work with state leaders to solve the root problems of inadequate housing once and for all.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the Florida REALTORS\u00ae public policy team used their efforts in Orange County to work with lawmakers to strengthen statewide measures against rent control. Those efforts paid off in the form of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/flsenate.gov\/Session\/Bill\/2023\/102\" data-di-id=\"di-id-44c4174b-d0aaffe5\">Senate Bill 102<\/a>, a comprehensive affordable housing bill that includes a rent control preemption to the state. If passed during Florida\u2019s 2023 legislative session, the bill would prevent local governments from enacting rent control laws.<\/p>\n<p>For other REALTOR<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0organizations facing legislative challenges, she adds, \u201cOur biggest takeaway is the importance of engaging early and taking the steps to use the resources and services that the REALTOR<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Party provides. \u00a0Be pro-active, not reactive!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how Florida REALTORS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0are working to defend against rent control measures in Orange County and across the state, contact\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:publicpolicy@floridarealtors.org\" data-di-id=\"di-id-90ee9c3-5996f80e\">publicpolicy@floridarealtors.org<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Unable to wait for a legal ruling to keep an unconstitutional rent control measure off the ballot in Orange County, Florida REALTORS\u00ae\u00a0launched a major campaign to discourage voters from accepting the measure.\u00a0 The effort targeted the county\u2019s renters and homeowners, saturating the respective voting pools with reasons not to adopt rent control, and demonstrated to the rest of the state that the REALTORS\u00ae\u00a0are prepared &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":5474,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-5471","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5471","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5471"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5471\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5474"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5471"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5471"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sharifrealty.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5471"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
