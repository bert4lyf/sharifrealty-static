When you&#8217;re buying a home, here&#8217;s what an agent who&#8217;s a REALTOR\u00ae can do for you.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Act as an expert guide. <\/strong>Buying a home typically requires a variety of forms, reports, disclosures, and other legal and financial documents. A knowledgeable real estate agent will know what&#8217;s required in your market, helping you avoid delays and costly mistakes. Also, there\u2019s a lot of jargon involved in a real estate transaction; you want to work with a professional who can speak the language.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offer objective information and opinions. <\/strong>A great real estate agent will guide you through the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.realtor\/daily-news\/2018\/12\/12\/why-you-shouldnt-put-a-home-search-on-hold-in-december\">home search<\/a>\u00a0with an unbiased eye, helping you meet your buying objectives while staying within your budget. Agents are also a great source when you have questions about local amenities, utilities, zoning rules, contractors, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give you expanded search power. <\/strong>You want access to the full range of opportunities. Using a cooperative system called the multiple listing service, your agent can help you evaluate all active listings that meet your criteria, alert you to listings soon to come on the market, and provide data on recent sales. Your agent can also save you time by helping you winnow away properties that are still appearing on public sites but are no longer on the market.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stand in your corner during negotiations. <\/strong>There are many factors up for discussion in any real estate transaction\u2014from price to repairs to possession date. A real estate professional who\u2019s representing you will look at the transaction from your perspective, helping you negotiate a purchase agreement that meets your needs and allows you to do due diligence before you\u2019re bound to the purchase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ensure an up-to-date experience. <\/strong>Most people buy only a few homes in a lifetime, usually with quite a few years between purchases. Even if you\u2019ve bought a home before, laws and regulations change. Real estate practitioners may handle hundreds or thousands of transactions over the course of their career.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be your rock during emotional moments. <\/strong>A home is so much more than four walls and a roof. And for most buyers, a home is the biggest purchase they\u2019ll ever make. Having a concerned, but objective, third party helps you stay focused on the issues most important to you when emotions threaten to sink an otherwise sound transaction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Provide fair and ethical\u00a0<\/strong><b>treatment. When<\/b>\u00a0you&#8217;re interviewing agents, ask if they&#8217;re a REALTOR\u00ae, a member of the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae. Every member must adhere to the REALTOR\u00ae Code of Ethics, which is based on professionalism, serving the interests of clients, and protecting the public.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] REALTORS\u00ae are members of the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae and subscribe to its strict Code of Ethics.
