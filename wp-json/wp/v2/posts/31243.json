Three out of four major U.S. regions experienced month-over-month sales declines and one region held steady. Year-over-year sales sank in all four regions.<\/p>\n<p>Total existing-home sales,<sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/research-and-statistics\/housing-statistics\/existing-home-sales\">https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/existing-home-sales<\/a>, completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, dipped 5.4% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.12 million in June. Year-over-year, sales fell 14.2% (5.97 million in June 2021).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Falling housing affordability continues to take a toll on potential home buyers,&#8221; said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. &#8220;Both mortgage rates and home prices have risen too sharply in a short span of time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Total housing inventory<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0registered at the end of June was 1,260,000 units, an increase of 9.6% from May and a 2.4% rise from the previous year (1.23 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.0-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 2.6 months in May and 2.5 months in June 2021.<\/p>\n<p>The median existing-home price<sup>3<\/sup>\u00a0for all housing types in June was $416,000, up 13.4% from June 2021 ($366,900), as prices increased in all regions. This marks 124 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.<\/p>\n<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 14 days in June, down from 16 days in May and 17 days in June 2021. The 14 days on market are the fewest since NAR began tracking it in May 2011. Eighty-eight percent of homes sold in June 2022 were on the market for less than a month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, there are more homes on the market,&#8221; Yun added. &#8220;Interestingly though, the record-low pace of days on market implies a fuzzier picture on home prices. Homes priced right are selling very quickly, but homes priced too high are deterring prospective buyers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>First-time buyers were responsible for 30% of sales in June, up from 27% in May and down from 31% in June 2021.

This and other news releases are posted in the newsroom at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/newsroom\">nar.realtor\/newsroom<\/a>. Statistical data in this release, as well as other tables and surveys, are posted in the &#8220;Research and Statistics&#8221; tab.<\/p>\n<p>Existing-home sales, which include single-family, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, are based on transaction closings from Multiple Listing Services. Changes in sales trends outside of MLSs are not captured in the monthly series. NAR benchmarks home sales periodically using other sources to assess overall home sales trends, including sales not reported by MLSs.<\/p>\n<p>Existing-home sales, based on closings, differ from the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s series on new single-family home sales, which are based on contracts or the acceptance of a deposit. Because of these differences, it is not uncommon for each series to move in different directions in the same month. In addition, existing-home sales, which account for more than 90% of total home sales, are based on a much larger data sample \u2013 about 40% of multiple listing service data each month \u2013 and typically are not subject to large prior-month revisions.<\/p>\n<p>The annual rate for a particular month represents what the total number of actual sales for a year would be if the relative pace for that month were maintained for 12 consecutive months. Seasonally adjusted annual rates are used in reporting monthly data to factor out seasonal variations in resale activity. For example, home sales volume is normally higher in the summer than in the winter, primarily because of differences in the weather and family buying patterns. However, seasonal factors cannot compensate for abnormal weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Single-family data collection began monthly in 1968, while condo data collection began quarterly in 1981; the series were combined in 1999 when monthly collection of condo data began. Prior to this period, single-family homes accounted for more than nine out of 10 purchases. Historic comparisons for total home sales prior to 1999 are based on monthly single-family sales, combined with the corresponding quarterly sales rate for condos.<\/p>\n<p>Total inventory and month&#8217;s supply data are available back through 1999, while single-family inventory and month&#8217;s supply are available back to 1982 (prior to 1999, single-family sales accounted for more than 90% of transactions and condos were measured only on a quarterly basis).<\/p>\n<p>The median price is where half sold for more and half sold for less; medians are more typical of market conditions than average prices, which are skewed higher by a relatively small share of upper-end transactions. The only valid comparisons for median prices are with the same period a year earlier due to seasonality in buying patterns. Month-to-month comparisons do not compensate for seasonal changes, especially for the timing of family buying patterns. Changes in the composition of sales can distort median price data. Year-ago median and mean prices sometimes are revised in an automated process if additional data is received.<\/p>\n<p>The national median condo\/co-op price often is higher than the median single-family home price because condos are concentrated in higher-cost housing markets. However, in a given area, single-family homes typically sell for more than condos as seen in NAR&#8217;s quarterly metro area price reports.<\/p>\n<p>Survey results represent owner-occupants and differ from separately reported monthly findings from NAR&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/research-and-statistics\/research-reports\/realtors-confidence-index\">Realtors\u00ae Confidence Index<\/a>, which include all types of buyers.
