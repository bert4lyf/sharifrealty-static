					<description><![CDATA[We were referred to Eric through our close friends and are so happy with the service he provided! This was our first house, so we had a lot of questions and he was happy to answer them all! He also went to bat for us and guided us to make smart decisions when it came to the negotiations. I hope to not move again anytime soon, but when we do, we know who to call!]]></description>
